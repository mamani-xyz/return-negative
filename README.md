Dart is a general-purpose programming language developed by Google for creating mobile, server, desktop, and web applications.

## About Return Negative

This repository presents you with a simple task, where you are assigned a number and you must make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

> Examples:

```dart
makeNegative(1);    // return -1
makeNegative(-5);   // return -5
makeNegative(0);    // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
```

> Notes:
- The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
- Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
